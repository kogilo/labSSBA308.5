// Plan 
    // -01- Input Data Validation - make sure that `AssignmentGroup` belong to `CourseInfo`,
    // throw error if incorrect data type and handle division by zero, if `points_possible` is zero.
   // 02 - Deadlines and penalties: 
    // - If the assignment is not yet due, exclude it
    // - If the learner submission is late, deduct 10% from his/her result.
// 03 - Calculate average score: calculate the weighted average for learner score. Assignments with more points should weight more.

// 04- Return the output in the following format"
